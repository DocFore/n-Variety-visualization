# n-Variety-visualization
A little program, made to project a n-Variety in 3D

Update 1 :
For now, you can only project an n-cube, and as many n-point, those points are randomized and are contained in an n-cube. And for now, you can only rotate, a single dimension.

Update 2 :
You can now, rotate your shape in more angles, thanks to an array, and the biggest part of the update is that you can now make a TRUE sphere, in the dimension you want, a fix is coming soon to increase the frame rate, it is low due to the big amount of points. I also made more class, to make my code more readable.

Update 3 :
The hypersphere have now less points, you can now add more circles to your sphere, it needs less computing.

Some updates are coming soon, like reducing the amount of point in an n-sphere, to make the code more efficient.
