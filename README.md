# n-Variety-visualization
A little program, made to project a n-Variety in 3D

For now, you can only project a n-cube, and as many n-point, you want these point are randomized, and are contained in a n-cube. And for now you can only rotate, a single dimension.

Some updates are coming soon (I hope).
